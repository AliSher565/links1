    <p>

        The history of Islam concerns the political, social, economic, military, and cultural developments of the Islamic civilization. Most historians believe that Islam originated in Mecca and Medina at the start of the 7th century CE. Muslims regard Islam as a return to the original faith of the Abrahamic prophets ALAHI SALAM  such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, and Jesus, with the submission (Islām) to the will of God.

        According to the traditional account, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad  SAWW began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations in 610 CE, calling for submission to the one God, the expectation of the imminent Last Judgement, and caring for the poor and needy. Muhammad's SAWW  message won over a handful of followers (the ṣaḥāba) and was met with increasing opposition from Meccan notables. In 622 CE, a few years after losing protection with the death of his influential uncle Abū Ṭālib ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, Muhammad SAWW migrated to the city of Yathrib (now known as Medina). With the death of Muhammad SAWW in 632 CE, Caliphs ruled Muslims</p>
