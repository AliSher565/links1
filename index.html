<h1> <center> <b> HISTORY</b></center></h1>
<P>
    History is the study of the human past as it is described in written documents left behind by humans. The past, with all of its complicated choices and events, participants dead and history told, is what the general public perceives to be the immutable bedrock on which historians and archaeologists stand.

But as purveyors of the past, historians recognize that the bedrock is really quicksand, that bits of each story are yet untold, and that what has been told is colored by the conditions of today. While not untrue to say that history is the study of the past, here is a collection of much more clear and accurate descriptions.
History is narratives. From chaos comes order. We seek to understand the past by determining and ordering ‘facts’; and from these narratives we hope to explain the decisions and processes which shape our existence. Perhaps we might even distill patterns and lessons to guide – but never to determine – our responses to the challenges faced today. History is the study of people, actions, decisions, interactions and behaviours. It is so compelling a subject because it encapsulates themes which expose the human condition in all of its guises and that resonate throughout time: power, weakness, corruption, tragedy, triumph … Nowhere are these themes clearer than in political history, still the necessary core of the field and the most meaningful of the myriad approaches to the study of history. Yet political history has fallen out of fashion and subsequently into disrepute, wrongly demonised as stale and irrelevant. The result has been to significantly erode the utility of ordering, explaining and distilling lessons from the past.

<h1><center> <b> IMPORTANCE OF HISTORY</b></center></h1>
<p>
History is important to study because it is essential for all of us in understanding ourselves and the world around us. There is a history of every field and topic, from medicine, to music, to art. To know and understand history is absolutely necessary, even though the results of historical study are not as visible, and less immediate.

<li> <u> OUR WORLD</u></li>
<p> History gives us a very clear picture of how the various aspects of society — such as technology, governmental systems, and even society as a whole — worked in the past so we understand how it came to work the way it is now.</p><br>
<li> <u> SOCIETY AND OTHER PEOPLE</u></li>
<p> Studying history allows us to observe and understand how people and societies behaved. For example, we are able to evaluate war, even when a nation is at peace, by looking back at previous events. History provides us with the data that is used to create laws, or theories about various aspects of society.</p> <br>
<li><u>IDENTITY</u></li>
<p> History can help provide us with a sense of identity. This is actually one of the main reasons that history is still taught in schools around the world. Historians have been able to learn about how countries, families, and groups were formed, and how they evolved and developed over time. When an individual takes it upon themselves to dive deep into their own family’s history, they can understand how their family interacted with larger historical change. Did family serve in major wars? Were they present for significant events?</p><br>
<li><u> PRESENT DAY ISSUES</u></li>
<p> helps us to understand present-day issues by asking deeper questions as to why things are the way they are. Why did wars in Europe in the 20th century matter to countries around the world? How did Hitler gain and maintain power for as long as he had? How has this had an effect on shaping our world and our global political system today?</p><br>
